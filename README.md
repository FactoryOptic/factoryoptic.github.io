# SYNCRO-LINK MARK ZERO is the production tool you need for streaming lens metadata for use in virtual production

# Why we made the SYNCRO-LINK MARK-ZERO
We designed and built this device to get factory calibrated, shutter sync'd lens metadata streaming into Unreal Engine with a single box that can be easily mounted to the camera. 

Having a laptop tethered to a live action camera during filming is a non-starter. The camera needs to move freely and space is always limited. We made the SYNCRO-LINK a cabled solution first that can be transported over RF, fiber optic or copper links. Wireless-only soltuions are never a good idea. If your RF becomes questionable, you can always fall back to an Ethernet cable. 

With Zeiss eXtended Data now providing OpenCV lens distortion values throughout the zoom range, this can be fed into your workflow without the need to perform time-consuming calibration at discrete focal lengths. You can be up and running with Zeiss and Fujinon full-frame lenses in a matter of minutes, using open source UE plugins and blueprints. 

Features
* Interfaces directly to Cooke /i metadata port on lens, bypassing the camera
* Streams focus distance, t-stop value, focal length entrance pupil position and more, at video framerate in perfect timing with the camera shutter
* Compatible with Zeiss eXtended Data used by Zeiss and Fujinon lenses
* Streams built in lens distortion, shading/vignetting values and entrance pupil position
* OLED display to show settings, live lens metadata and more
* Samples lens metadata synchronously with video genlock
* Streams timecode stamped metadata over UDP from 23.98fps to 60fps
* Interfaces directly to Unreal Engine using [open-source plugin & blueprint](https://github.com/MadlyFX/LONET-Unreal-Plugin), or create your own interface using the documented UDP protocol
* Powered via PoE (802.3af) or 2 pin Lemo, or both, for redundancy
