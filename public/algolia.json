Use analog D/As if device/clock has insufficient outputs. BNC Tees are discouraged.\nFactory Optic Lens Cable This cable is designed to connect to the RS232 port on the SYNCRO-LINK. The SYNCRO-LINK is wired for standard RS232 for data and signal ground, and DC power is connected to Ring Indicator pin (pin 9). This is required for providing power to the lens data connector.\nThe blue LED on the D-SUB housing indicates the presence of power with the correct polarity.\nThe cable has an internal fuse and reverse polarity protection circuitry to protect the lens from damage.\nTo use the cable with a standard computer RS232 port, a DC input jack is provided on the rear of the D-SUB shell. This jack is a standard DC power jack, 2.1x5.5mm with center pin positive.
